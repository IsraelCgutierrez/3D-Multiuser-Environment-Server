3D-Multiuser-Environment-Server
===============================

The objective of this project is to develop a 3D environment with network communication technology based on Java3D. A virtual space in which users can interact with each other and change their environment. For this purpose we have developed a server application in order to maintain the virtual environment, and a client application that each user can view and interact with the environment in real time.
